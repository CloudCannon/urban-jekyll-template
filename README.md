Install the dependencies with [Bundler](http://bundler.io/):

~~~

Run `jekyll` commands through Bundler to ensure you're using the right versions:

~~~bash
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
~~~

## Editing

This template is already optimised for adding, updating and removing pages, staff, advice, company details and footer elements.

### Posts

* Add, update or remove a post in the *Posts* collection.
* The **Staff Author** field links to members in the **Staff** collection.
* Documentation pages are organised in the navigation by category, with URLs based on the path inside the `_docs` folder.
* Change the defaults when new posts are created in `_posts/_defaults.md`.

### Contact Form

* Preconfigured to work with [CloudCannon](https://app.cloudcannon.com/), but easily changed to another provider (e.g. [FormSpree](https://formspree.io/)).
* Sends email to the address listed in company details.

### Staff

* Reused around the site to save multiple editing locations.
* Add `excluded_in_search: true` to any documentation page's front matter to exclude that page in the search results.

### Footer

* Exposed as a data file to give clients better access.
* Set in the *Data* / *Footer* section.

### Company details

* Reused around the site to save multiple editing locations.
* Set in the *Data* / *Company* section.
